# Web Scraping News Sources Using COVID-19 Terminology
This repo consists of files to scrape articles from the following eight news sources:
  - CNN
  - Fox News
  - New York Times
  - Wall Street Journal
  - Slate
  - Breitbart
  - Buzzfeed News
  - The Blaze

Articles were scraped based on predetermined COVID-19 related terminology, then a randomized number of articles was selected to generate our dataset.

*Note: This repo is not actively being developed, and these files were uploaded for demonstration purposes only. If you would like more information on my work or on this specific project, please send me an email at ykhaley@crimson.ua.edu.*
